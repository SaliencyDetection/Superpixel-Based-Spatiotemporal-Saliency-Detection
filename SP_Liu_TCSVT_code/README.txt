1. This code is for the paper: [1] 'Z. Liu, X. Zhang, S. Luo, O. Le Meur, Superpixel-based spatiotemporal saliency detection,IEEE Trans. Circuits Syst. Video Technol. 24 (9) (2014) 1522¨C1540.'
   and can only be used for non-comercial purpose,if you use our code,please cite our paper[1].

2. This code is mainly designed for Matlab R2013a under Window7 x64. Could also be run under Liunx. 

3. The superpixel segmentation  need vlfeat toolbox.

4. "runme.m" is the main function.

5. An example video and several saliency maps are included in the folder "Data/InputVideos", and you can test it directly by running "runme.m".  
   you can change the video path througth 'setpath.m', and the code only avilable for the video of the .avi format.
